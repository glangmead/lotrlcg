Tools to help play The Lord of the Rings LCG digitally

* RingLord: An Xcode project for importing the OCTGN plugin data into an app

* hallofbeorn: This directory contains instructions and scripts for crawling data and images from hallofbeorn.com and making CardWarden boxes to hold whatever sets you want

* lackey: This directory contains a script to convert data from the lackey plugin to a CardWarden box. The tradeoff here is that the Lackey plugin isn't up to date with all the expansions, but you don't have to crawl hallofbeorn.com and all the images are already local (if you make sure to click the button in the plugin to download them all).
